# Trivia App

## Overview
This application is the quiz app which everyone can add, delete, and play quizzes by themselves.
The functions of this app are as follows:

1. Display questions - both all questions and by category. Questions should show the question, category and difficulty rating by default and can show/hide the answer.
2. Delete questions.
3. Add questions and require that they include question and answer text.
4. Search for questions based on a text query string.
5. Play the quiz game, randomizing either all questions or within a specific category.
